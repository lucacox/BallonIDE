# BallonIDE

The idea comes from CodeBubbles (http://cs.brown.edu/~spr/codebubbles/).

The project is based on node.js (http://nodejs.org), AngularJS (https://angularjs.org/) and TypeScript (http://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## The IDE should offer
* code ballons!
* project structure/navigation
* syntax highlighting
* code inspection
* auto-complete and content assist
* ballons navigation
* normal editor features (undo, search, etc...)
* ...

## The IDE now offers
* project structure/navigiation (almost)
* syntax highlighting (provided by CodeMirror)
* code inspection for JavaScript based on Esprima

## Third Party libraries
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Express (http://expressjs.com/)
* Esprima (http://esprima.org/)
* CodeMirror (http://codemirror.net/)
